shiny-ninja-tm
==============

A TextMate/Sublime Text port of [shiny-ninja.vim](http://xonecas.github.com/assets/shiny-ninja.vim).

If you want to help:

* Fields that are `bold + italic + underlined + magenta` text are fields I haven't customized yet so they will show up brightly
* I'd like to port all existing fields from `Monokai Bright.tmTheme` as it seems to be the most complete one I use regularly (start here!)
